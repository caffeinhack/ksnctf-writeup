# Simple Auth

## Problem
> simple vulnerability
> http://ctfq.sweetduet.info:10080/~q32/auth.php
> [source](http://ksnctf.sweetduet.info/q/32/auth.php)

## Solution
### 1. Check Source Code
First, check the source code.

As title say, it is simple source code.
But in the 11 line, the source says it verifies with `strcasecmp()`.
So search vulnerability of `strcasecmp()` with google.

### 2. Search Vulnerability
In my case, I found this site.
> http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hnw/20090123

This site says, when argument is array, strcasecmp return true.  
So if `$POST['password']` has array, it is pass the authentication. 

### 3. Attack
Then, attack with burpsuite following below.

1. Access the [site](http://ctfq.sweetduet.info:10080/~q32/auth.php) with your browser.
2. Open burpsuite.
3. Browser proxy set it burpsuite's.
4. Type "hoge" to site form, and submit.
5. Check burpsuite and change from `password=hoge` to `password[]=hoge`,  
and you can get the flag.
